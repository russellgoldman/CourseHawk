## Inspiration
Searching for courses to take through traditional academic calendars is a frustrating process. Having to navigate to a new page through countless departments to get an idea of certain courses can quickly become a headache.

CourseHawk hopes to alleviate this by creating a central hub where students at Wilfrid Laurier University (or anyone that has an iOS or Android phone) can find their courses in an organized and helpful manner.

## Technology
CourseHawk is built with React Native, Redux, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mocha, and Python. Special thanks to http://novicelab.org/jsonabc/ for their alphabetical JSON converter, it was invaluable.
