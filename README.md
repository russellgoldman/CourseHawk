## Inspiration
Searching for courses to take through traditional academic calendars is a frustrating process. Having to navigate to a new page through countless departments to get an idea of certain courses can quickly become a headache.
CourseHawk hopes to alleviate this by creating a central hub where students at Wilfrid Laurier University (or anyone that has an iOS or Android phone) can find their courses in an organized and helpful manner.

## Features
CourseHawk comes with many useful features to aid students in finding the right courses for them. Users can filter courses based on a variety of factors, such as:
- Department
- Course Level
- Has lectures? (If so, how many hours per week)
- Has labs? (If so, how many per week)
- Has Prereqs? (If so how many)
- Has Co-Reqs? (If so how many)
- Has Exclusions? (if so how many)
- User Ratings

## User Accounts
Users can create an account to access more advanced features, such as posting and viewing course ratings, adding courses to a wishlist and even tracking previously taken courses with a handy GPA calculator.

## Technology
CourseHawk is built with React Native, Redux, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mocha, and Python. Special thanks to http://novicelab.org/jsonabc/ for their alphabetical JSON converter, it was invaluable.
