The key objective of this course is to familiarize the students with key information technologies used in manipulating, storing, and analyzing big data. We look at the basic tools for statistical analysis, R and Python, and some key methods of machine learning. We review MapReduce techniques for parallel processing, Hadoop, an open source framework for running MapReduce on Internet scale problems and HDFS, Hadoop's Distributed File System. We teach Spark which emerged as the most important big data processing framework. We touch on tools that provide SQL-like access to unstructured data like Hive. We analyze so-called NoSQL storage solutions exemplified by Cassandra for their critical features: speed of reads and writes, and ability to scale to extreme volumes. We examine memory resident databases (VoltDB, SciDB) and graph databases (Ne4J). Students gain the ability to initiate and design highly scalable systems that can accept, store, and analyze large volumes of unstructured.data in batch mode and/or real time. Most lectures are presented using Java examples. Some lectures use Python and R.",

Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people's opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.",

Students will discover that such data tend to exhibit heavy tails, asymmetry and non-stationary parameters.● Using regression techniques to assess the predictive power of so-called factor models for stock returns, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. Students will determine the predictive power (or lack thereof) of various factors (such as beta or momentum) in explaining the performance of various stocks.● Assess the empirical performance of various portfolio optimization methods, such as mean-variance optimization and Black-Litterman approach.● The difference between parameter estimation (using historical data) and calibration (using current option price data).● Dimension reduction for high-dimensional data, such as principal component analysis and techniques for cleaning the spectrum of empirical covariance matrices.● Volatility forecasting using GARCH and/or regime-switching models.",
